## Project Overview

Shared GitHub Copilot instructions, Claude Code DevEx hooks, reusable CI templates,
and standards for the ecosystem.

## Repository Structure
```
.claude/hooks/          # Claude Code DevEx hooks (circuit breaker, secret scanner, etc.)
.claude/settings.json   # Claude Code hook configuration
.claude/skills/         # On-demand skill modules (auto-invoked SKILL.md per domain)
  testing-pytest/       # pytest DDD + pytest-mock + constants pattern
  dockerfile-multistage/# 4-stage base/builder/production/dev — Python 3.14
  api-design/           # REST standards + FastAPI patterns + status codes
copilot-instructions/   # GitHub Copilot instruction templates (base.md = ecosystem-wide)
templates/              # Bootstrap file templates (CLAUDE.md, opencode.json, settings.json, copilot-instructions.md, .gitignore, dependabot.yml, etc.)
templates/docs-structure/ # Standardized project documentation skeleton (docs, ai, prompts, schemas, workflows, decisions, postmortems, tests, examples/{python,node}) — copied by /chrysa-init
workflows/              # Reusable GitHub Actions workflow templates
```

## Development Setup
```bash
make install  # Install pre-commit hooks
make lint     # Run pre-commit on all files
```

## Adding a new skill
1. Create `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. Define: when to auto-invoke, concrete rules, code patterns, forbidden patterns
3. Reference it from the project's CLAUDE.md under `## Skills`

## Adding a new hook
1. Create `hooks/<name>.cjs` in `.claude/hooks/`
2. Add it to `.claude/settings.json` under the correct lifecycle event
3. Document it in `.claude/HOOKS_README.md`
4. Tag model-specific rules with `@[MODEL_NAME]`

## Adding a new template
1. Create the file in `templates/` (or `workflows/`)
2. Use `${REPO_NAME}`, `${DESCRIPTION}` placeholders for project-init substitution
3. Update `README.md` with the new template reference

## CI/CD
- Pre-commit: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- CI validation: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- PR labeler: `.github/workflows/labeler.yml`
- PR dependency check: `.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`

## Notion Branch Sync workflow

`workflows/notion-branch-sync.yml` — triggers on every push to every branch.

**What it does:**
1. Creates / updates a row in the shared `NOTION_BRANCHES_DB_ID` database (one row per repo+branch).
2. On `main`/`master` push: syncs the latest CHANGELOG.md entry to the roadmap table row (`NOTION_PROJECT_BLOCK_ID`).

**One-time Notion setup** (do once for the whole ecosystem):
1. Create a Notion database called "Branch Activity" with these exact property names:
   - `Branch` (Title), `Repo` (Text), `Status` (Select: active/stale/merged),
     `Last SHA` (Text), `Commit Msg` (Text), `Author` (Text),
     `PR Count` (Number), `CI Status` (Select: passing/failing/unknown),
     `Changelog` (Text), `Updated At` (Date)
2. Copy the database UUID and add it as an **org-level variable**: `NOTION_BRANCHES_DB_ID`

**Per-repo setup:**
| Variable | Scope | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NOTION_BRANCHES_DB_ID` | org | yes | shared Branch Activity DB UUID |
| `NOTION_PROJECT_BLOCK_ID` | repo | only for changelog sync | table row block UUID (same as `notion-roadmap-sync.yml`) |

**Secrets required (org level):** `NOTION_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided by Actions)

## Code Standards
- All YAML files sorted (via yaml-sorter) except `.github/` workflows
- Templates must be valid YAML/JSON (validated in CI)
- **No nested named functions > 5 lines** (cross-repo · Notion ADR 2026-04-26).
  Extract to top-level. Lambdas/arrows inline (callbacks `map`/`filter`/`reduce`,
  predicates 1-3 lines) and private 1-call closure factories are OK.
  Lints to enforce:
  - Python (Ruff): `PLR0915` + custom `def-inside-def` check
  - TypeScript (ESLint): `max-nested-callbacks: ["error", 2]` + `func-style: ["error", "declaration"]`
  - Bash: shellcheck `SC2317` + manual review on 5+ line nested helpers

## Key Hooks
| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| secret-scanner.cjs | PreToolUse (git commit) | Block secrets from being committed |
| check-no-env-files.cjs | PreToolUse (git commit) · CLI `--ci` | Block `.env` secret files (AG-005) — config injected at runtime |
| circuit-breaker.cjs | PreToolUse (API calls) | Prevent repeated failing API calls |
| frustration-detection.cjs | UserPromptSubmit | Inject context on frustrating prompts |
| verifiable-thresholds.cjs | PostToolUse (file writes) | Warn on quality threshold violations |
| memory-consolidation.cjs | CLI | Consolidate and compress memory files |
| model-debt-inventory.cjs | CLI | Audit model-specific tagged rules |

## Compact instructions

When compacting, always preserve:
1. List of all files modified this session (with paths)
2. Current task description and next steps
3. Any uncommitted / unpushed changes
4. Open blockers and errors not yet resolved

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **shared-standards** (318 symbols, 312 relationships, 0 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

# chrysa — Transverse Standards (core)

> The **slim always-on core**. The canonical, tool-agnostic source of truth is `standards/STANDARDS.chrysa.md`; the normative annexes live under `standards/annexes/`. Each rule below is a one-line pointer — its full text lives in the per-domain file named beside the heading (`standards/rules/<domain>.md`), read on demand.

**Where an annexe and the canon disagree, the canon wins.**

### Governance, language & compliance · `standards/rules/governance.md`
- Normative annexes
- Language
- Compliance targets
- Governance — strategic pillars & ADR format

### Cross-cutting stack · `standards/rules/stack.md`
- Cross-cutting stack (settled ADRs — do not relitigate)

### SCM — branches, commits & pull requests · `standards/rules/scm.md`
- Commits
- Branches
- Branch model — `main` is production, `develop` is the workspace
- Merge
- One PR per issue
- Issues and PRs are type-driven

### Architecture, decoupling & portability · `standards/rules/architecture.md`
- Repo provenance — every code repo depends on `project-init`
- Every repo declares its profile and DDD level
- Projects talk through versioned contracts only
- Everything is machine-agnostic and portable — no rule, repo, or script is bound to one machine
- Every external server the service talks to is addressed through the environment — never hardcoded
- Every tracked file and folder must earn its place — a repo holds only what is useful to it now
- The repository architecture is legible to an agent — optimised for Claude, not only for humans
- Deferred work is a governed job, not a fire-and-forget

### Testing · `standards/rules/testing.md`
- Tests: pytest only
- Frontend tests: Vitest + Testing Library + MSW — from the scaffold, not later

### Frontend & web semantics · `standards/rules/frontend.md`
- TypeScript is strict by contract
- The JS/TS package manager is `pnpm` — `npm` and `yarn` are forbidden
- React is a presentation layer, not the domain
- The frontend says when the backend is unreachable or unstable
- The frontend is reactive and real-time by default
- UI state survives reload & focus
- Everything is semantic — the markup, the data, and the URLs
- URL-addressable frontend navigation — mandatory

### APIs, contracts & real-time · `standards/rules/api.md`
- A real-time backend has channel contracts and never blocks
- APIs, SDKs & public contracts follow the `STD-API-001` contract

### Accessibility · `standards/rules/accessibility.md`
- Dark mode
- Every site is usable by the majority of disabilities — not only the screen-reader case

### Documentation & session state · `standards/rules/docs.md`
- Notion logging
- Documentation and Notion are maintained in lockstep with the code — a change that leaves them stale is unfinished
- Session lifecycle (primer + memory + hindsight)

### AI agents & features · `standards/rules/agents.md`
- Agent actions are governed
- An AI feature is evaluated, not just shipped
- An agent writes only where the owner owns

### Security, identity & sessions · `standards/rules/security.md`
- Per-person data implies a user account — no exceptions dressed up as simplicity
- Identity goes through the cluster SSO first
- Rights are resolved against the common directory (LDAP), never re-declared per service
- A session is secured and it expires
- Every form is a hostile input surface — validate on the server, always

### Code quality & anti-patterns · `standards/rules/code-quality.md`
- No hardcoded constants
- No literal HTTP status codes — use the constants the framework already ships
- No code duplication — the second occurrence is an extraction order
- Raised errors are typed
- Failures are contained, and observable
- Prefer a lookup table to a state machine
- Decompose into small, independently unit-testable methods
- Code is read far more often than it is written — optimise for the reader, and standardise the form
- Avoid lambdas and anonymous constructs — a named function is the default
- Basic optimisations and known anti-patterns are caught in review and in CI
- A cache is a correctness contract, not a sprinkle of speed
- Quality gates
- Error handling pattern (all automations)

### Backend Python · `standards/rules/backend-python.md`
- Python packaging — `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth
- Python is written object-oriented, one class per file
- Import the item, not the module — `from x import y; y()`
- Functions and methods are called with named arguments — positional call sites are the exception, not the rule

### Data, persistence & migrations · `standards/rules/data.md`
- Data, persistence & migrations follow the `STD-DATA-001` contract

### Observability & operations · `standards/rules/observability.md`
- Observability & production readiness follow the `STD-OPS-001` contract
- The container is versioned separately from the application it hosts, and an admin can see what is actually deployed
- Observability — error-tracking → GitHub issues (norm)

### Containers & compose · `standards/rules/containers.md`
- Everything runs in a container — the only exception is the slice of a repo genuinely bound to the host OS
- External dependencies are installed in containers, never on the host
- No virtualenv in a repo — ever
- Tool caches & deps never touch the project tree
- Dockerfiles are multi-stage, with a `production` and a `dev` stage — mandatory
- App containers ship the app only — the platform layer is the owner's responsibility
- Only a publicly useful port is published — everything else stays on the container network
- A compose file is minimal — declare only what the stack needs, default the rest
- Dev stage must hot-reload
- Local dev runs the code in-container, live, in debug mode — never the production server
- Default to dev mode when starting an app locally — any other mode only when explicitly asked
- `.dockerignore` mandatory & exhaustive
- Container-runtime policy

### Product surfaces · `standards/rules/product.md`
- Setup wizard & config panel
- A game is DRM-free and fully playable solo offline
- Every product that is operated ships a management backoffice
- If a user can supply a file, the product accepts an upload
- A floating assistant where it earns its place — never as decoration

### Design system · `standards/rules/design.md`
- Design system

### Developer loop & tooling · `standards/rules/dev-loop.md`
- Makefile targets
- Shared skills (load on demand from shared-standards/.claude/skills/)

### CI/CD, pre-commit & release · `standards/rules/ci-cd.md`
- Release & changelog config (canonical)
- GitHub Actions (reuse first · custom actions centralised · thin workflows)
- Pre-commit & git hooks (native, via pre-commit.com — never wrapped in make)
