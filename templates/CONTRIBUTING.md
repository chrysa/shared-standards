# Contributing to ${REPO_NAME}

Thanks for contributing. This repo follows the chrysa
[Execution Standard](https://github.com/chrysa/shared-standards/blob/main/EXECUTION_STANDARD.md).

## Prerequisites

```bash
make install   # install dev dependencies + pre-commit hooks
```

## Workflow

1. **Branch** from `main` using a typed prefix:
   `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `ci/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `perf/`.
   Direct commits to `main` are blocked (`no-commit-to-branch`).
2. **Develop** using the `make` targets only — never call `pytest`/`ruff`/`mypy`
   directly on the host:
   - `make test` — run unit tests
   - `make test-cov` — tests with coverage
   - `make lint` — linter
   - `make format` — auto-format
   - `make typecheck` — static type check
3. **Commit** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   `type(scope): subject` (allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test,
   chore, perf, revert, ci). Commit messages are linted via `conventional-pre-commit`.
4. **Verify** before pushing:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   make test
   ```
5. **Open a PR** against `main`. CI (pre-commit, lint, test, sonar) must pass and
   one approval is required before merge.

## Code standards

- All committed files (code, comments, docs, config) are in **English**.
- No hardcoded secrets — use env vars and keep `.env.example` in sync.
- New behaviour ships with tests; keep coverage at or above the project threshold.

## Reporting issues

Use the issue templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Include reproduction steps,
expected vs actual behaviour, and environment details.
